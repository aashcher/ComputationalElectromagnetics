% S-matrix multiplication
%% input:
% SM1, SM2: low and upper S-matrices of size 2-by-2
%% output:
% SM: composition S-matrix of size 2-by-2
%% implementation:
function [SM] = smatrix_multiply(SM1, SM2)
    tv = 1/(1 - SM1(2,2)*SM2(1,1));
    SM(2,1) = tv*SM1(2,1)*SM2(2,1);
    SM(1,1) = SM1(1,1) + tv*SM1(2,1)*SM1(1,2)*SM2(1,1);
    SM(1,2) = tv*SM2(1,2)*SM1(1,2);
    SM(2,2) = SM2(2,2) + tv*SM2(1,2)*SM2(2,1)*SM1(2,2);
