%% description:
% calculate 2-by-2 S-matrix of a homogeneous layer
%% input:
% kh: layer thickness multiplied by the vacuum wavenumber
% kx0: in-plane wavevector projection 
% eps: layer permittivity
%% output:
% SML: S-matrix of size 2-by-2
%% implementation:
function [SML] = smatrix_layer(kh, eps, kx0)
    SML = zeros(2,2);
    tv = exp(1i*kh*sqrt(eps - kx0^2));
    SML(2,1) = tv;
    SML(1,2) = tv;
